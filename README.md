# Windows ArgumentCatcher
===============

A small tool for developers and admins which shows the the arguments passed to the application as Windows-Debug-/ and Console Messages.


## Version 1
Simple Tool which takes arguments passed to this application and write them to a debug output.
This is useful if you like to analyze not working scripts, protocol handlers and so on.
Just replace the original executable with this tool and use debugview from sysinternals to see what has happened.
